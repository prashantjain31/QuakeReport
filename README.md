# QuakeReport #

This app shows the list of earthquakes and sorts them on the basis
of magnitude of the earthquake and the time of occurence . It also shows the
location where the earthquake occurred. All the data of earthquakes is retrieved
from the USGS Website by using API calls. App uses Asynchronous Tasks to
prevent main thread from getting blocked by time consuming API calls, so that
app remains responsive even if data is being fetched from the internet. This app
uses Recycler View so that no excessive memory is consumed by the list of the
earthquakes
